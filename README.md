# RAPIDS Academy Repository

Welcome to the RAPIDS Academy git repository!

RAPIDS Academy gives a way to learn Python GPU coding and data science from top project creators and contributors. We've come together to provide GPU tutorials, classes, and trainings based on our diverse and long-running experiences. For further information, see [our official website](http://learnrapids.com/).

This git repository is a place to get access to our guides and lessons that go along with our live streams and instructor-led labs.

## Get started

[See our instructions](https://github.com/RAPIDSAcademy/rapidsacademy/blob/master/tutorials/security/tour/setup.ipynb) for self-hosted Jupyter, free Google Colab (slow setup), free app.blazingsql.com, and [Graphistry private cloud instance](https://www.graphistry.com/get-started) (use AWS g4dn). For free Graphistry API access, register an [Graphistry Hub account](https://www.graphistry.com/get-started).
