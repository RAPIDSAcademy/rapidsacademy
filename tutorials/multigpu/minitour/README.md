# Out-of-core data with BlazingSQL

Felipe Aramburu, CTO of [BlazingSQL](https://blazingsql.com), looks in-depth how out-of-core query execution works with BlazingSQL.
We'll demonstrate single-node multi-GPU with Dask, before guiding everyone through a short set of queries that query datasets larger than available GPU memory.


## Learn

* The two notebooks in this folder provide examples of handling large datasets in BlazingSQL
* The second was used as part of winning the TPC big data benchmarks.

## Try

1. Create a free notebook account at [app.blazingsql.com](https://app.blazingsql.com)
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/RAPIDSAcademy/rapidsacademy.git`
1. Walk through the first notebook

## Private setup

Same setup as in the [data science walkthrough](https://github.com/RAPIDSAcademy/rapidsacademy/blob/master/tutorials/datasci/tour/setup.ipynb)
